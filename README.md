# Todo-List
Introduction:

In this android development project, we made a simple “To Do List”
with real-time Database and Fire-store Database. This ‘To Do list’ is
a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your
day-to-day. You can use ‘To Do List’ to make shopping lists or task
checklist, take notes, plan an event, or set reminders to increase your
productivity and focus on what matters to you. ‘To Do List’ makes it
easy to stay organized and manage your life.

Motivation:

Almost everyone struggles with getting stuff done. But some of us struggle with
the stage before that: just figuring out what it is we need to do. The to-do list is
the answer. It’s a time-honored system that’s beautiful in its simplicity: work out
what needs to be done and in what order, write down the tasks, do them, and then,
one-by-one, cross them out. Nobody is capable of remembering everything at all
times. To-do lists are a useful external memory aid that give you permission to
forget. As long as you can remember to look at your to-do list, you will never lose
anything that you have recorded on it.
